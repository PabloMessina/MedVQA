    A: extremely narrow sagittal diameter of the chest and extensive fat deposition , also explaining thickening of the pleural margins bilaterally
    A: Note is also made of a large trachea , approaching 2 , 5 cm in coronal and 2 cm in the sagittal diameter in this patient with known tracheomalacia
    A: lateral chest compared to : Hyperinflation and the sagittal elongation of the trachea suggests chronic obstructive lung disease , particularly emphysema
