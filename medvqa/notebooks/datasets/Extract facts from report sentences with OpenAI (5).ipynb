      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 3316. Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show resolution versus consideration of chest CT if the likely etiology is not very clear at clinical grounds.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 3790. In light of patient's history of metastatic breast cancer, dedicated cross-sectional imaging by CT is suggested unless recent scan was performed elsewhere for further evaluation.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 4263. Catheters project over the anterior subcutaneous soft tissues as well as the right upper quadrant for which clinical correlation is suggested.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 4737. Although this could represent atelectatic change, in the appropriate clinical setting developing pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 5210. Study is very limited due to volume loss along the right chest as well as pleural calcifications.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 5684. Although this may be better visualized on the current examination due to differences in positioning, with the history of multiple attempts at central line placement, superimposed acute hemorrhage into the pleural space should also be clinically considered.\n",

      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 6631. Linear opacity along the peripheral left lung is nonspecific, though could represent a loculated collection following pleural biopsy.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 7105. However, upon review of numerous prior chest radiographs, there is no evidence of lung hyperexpansion at times when the pulmonary parenchyma appears most pathologic, mass making asthma an unlikely primary diagnosis.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 7579. The left sided rib fractures and scapular fracture are redemonstrated, though better appreciated by CT. Clear right lung.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 8052. Substantial degenerative changes in the right glenohumeral joint are demonstrated, partially imaged and might be correlated with dedicated imaging if clinically warranted.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 8526. Additional subtle opacity at the right upper lung laterally which could be seen in the setting of pneumonia although additional follow-up of this region is suggested as well.\n",
      "2024-03-20 18:30:52,757 - \u001b[1;32mINFO\u001b[1;0m - 9000. In comparison with the study of , there is again hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease with pleural thickening and blunting of the costophrenic sinuses as well as postsurgical changes at the right hilum and resection of the right upper rib.\n",
